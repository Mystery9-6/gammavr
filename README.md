# GammaVR
[DISCLAIMER: This is a PRE-ALPHA of GammaVR, so expect things to change and/or break AT ANY TIME.]


If you didn't already know, GammaVR is my attempt at a proper VR engine for the programming language Scratch.


I have committed to this project, so it most likely won't be abandoned unless proved impossible or if other issues arise.


The base is a 3D engine by the name of Gamma Engine by the Scratcher @littlebunny06. GammaVR will (hopefully) slowly but surely create a VR engine for Gamma Engine.

Report issues in this repo, or on my Scratch profile (@Mystery96)

[P.S. ONLY RUN THE BASE IN TURBOWARP, THANK YOU!]
